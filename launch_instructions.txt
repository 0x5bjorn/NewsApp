------------------------------------------------------
Depending on the Docker Compose version use:
    - docker compose 
OR
    - docker-compose
-------------------------------------------------------

First/initial launch commands:
    - docker-compose up --build -d
    - docker-compose exec webapp python3 manage.py migrate
Then go to "localhost:8000" on web browser.

For next subsequent launches use command:
    - docker-compose up -d

!!! WARNING !!!
If you don't see anything on "localhost:8000" then re-launch containers:
    - docker-compose down
    - docker-compose up -d
And go to "localhost:8000" on web browser again.

This error might be because after the first launch of the containers 
web application was built and launched earlier than database system.
It can be fixed by creating shell script which will put the web application's launch on wait 
until database system starts running.
This shell script must be set as an entrypoint in Dockerfile for web application. 
Unfortunately, I didn't manage to do it on time.
